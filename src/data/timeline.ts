/* The dated record behind /timeline and `cat experience`.

   Every entry is traced to Connor's résumé facts file (the approved wording
   behind public/Connor_Murphy_Resume.pdf); anything the facts file does not
   state is left out. Dates keep the resume's own precision: a
   month when the resume gives a month, a bare year when it gives only a year.
   Nothing is interpolated, so a year-only entry is drawn as the whole year and
   labelled as year precision rather than given an invented month.

   `slug` links an entry to its destination, and only a verified destination
   is linked. The timeline never introduces a URL of its own. */
